Day by day advancements can be seen in the field of Blockchain. It is a decenteralized network where peer to peer transactions take place. Blockchain has various applications one of the application is marketplace which is a decenteralized open network where sellers and buyers come together.

I build this project using Ethereum smart contracts and integrating with React as frontend. The project focuses on the part where a seller can add products on an open network and a buyer can purchase directly from the seller, after purchasing it some fields will get updated like the address of the owner will change, etc.

The advantages of Blockchain marketplace is that it aims on security and transparency issues faced on traditional marketplaces.
